Welcome! This is a portfolio created by Ryan Rader

Please browse around to see examples of things I've done.


## Jekyll example

The site you're viewing right now is an example of what I can build with jekyll. I built the site in a github repo and hosted it on github pages. 


## OpenAPI example

I have created a lot of documentation for developers over the years. I have also taken several courses about how to create API docs.

To demonstrate, I created an API documentation site on github that uses data from an open source weather API. I built the site with the highly respected and most commonly used specification: OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger). I'm very experienced with CSS, so I can style sites like this to fit any branding and format that a company needs. You can see this site <a href="https://lookatthem-tech.github.io/open-api-example/" target="_blank">here</a>.




## Github site example

To further demonstrate my capabilities to work with modern developer doc tools, I built, edited, versioned, and deployed a portfolio site in github. You can see it <a href="https://lookatthem-tech.github.io/portfolio005/Content/Topics/HomePgG.htm" target="_blank">here</a>


## Sphinx site example

I have a similar portfolio site that I built with sphinx to demonstrate what I can do with that tool.

## API course certificates

Also, here are certificates for a few of the API courses that I've completed.
