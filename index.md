## Welcome! This is a portfolio created by Ryan Rader

Please browse around to see examples of things I've done.


### Jekyll example

The site you're viewing right now is an example of what I can build with jekyll. I built the site in a github repo and hosted it on github pages. 


### OpenAPI example

I have created a lot of documentation for developers over the years. I have also taken several courses about how to create API docs.

To demonstrate, I created an API documentation site on github that uses data from an open source weather API. I built the site with the highly respected and most commonly used specification: OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger). I'm very experienced with CSS, so I can style sites like this to fit any branding and format that a company needs. Click the following image to open the site.

### Github site example

To further demonstrate my capabilities to work with modern developer doc tools, I built, edited, versioned, and deployed a portfolio site in github. You can see it here LINK!!!!


### Sphinx site example

I have a similar portfolio site that I built with sphinx. I'll be happy to show it to anyone who asks!


### API course certificates

Also, here are certificates for a few of the API courses that I've completed.
