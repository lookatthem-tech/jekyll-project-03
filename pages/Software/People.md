<p>People in Prysm (sometimes referred to as Participants) are the people who have access to your project. People can be members or guests.</p>

<p><b>Tip: </b></span></span></span>Up to 15 people can be in a project simultaneously, and up to 10 of those people can be guests.</p>

<h2>Members</h2>

<p>Members are people on the same Prysm account as you. For example, if you work for Acme Corporation, and you want to invite a collaborator who also works for Acme Corporation, this collaborator will be a member in your project.</p>

<h2>Guests</h2>

<p>Guests are people who are invited to the project by a member. Guests can be either of these types:</p>
<ul>
<li>A person who does not have a Prysm license. These guests can create a guest account in Prysm after you invite them.</li>
<li>A person who has a Prysm license, but is not on the same account as the project to which you are inviting them. For example, if you work for Acme Corporation, and you want to invite a collaborator from Generic Incorporated (a company that also uses Prysm), this collaborator will be a guest in your project.</li>
</ul>

<p> Guests can access the project only while another project member is accessing it. Guests can sign in only through Prysm for web.</p>

<h2>Managing people in projects</h2>


<p>In Prysm for web, you can find information about people in the project in the People panel. Open and close the People panel by clicking the People button.</p>
<p>In Prysm for rooms, information about people in the project is in the Project Participants panel on the right side of the display.</p>
<p>From the People panel (in Prysm for web) or the Project Participants panel (in Prysm for rooms), you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>See who is currently in your project.</li>
<li>Add or remove <a href="AddingAllPeople.html#AddingMembersToProject">members</a> and <a href="AddingAllPeople.html#AddingGuestsToProject">guests</a>.</li>
<li>Interact with the <a href="#Understa">project lobby</a>.</li>
<li>Start Follow Me so that other users can follow a presentation, or stop Follow Me so that participants can collaborate interactively. For more information, see <a href="FollowMeMode.html" class="MCXref xref">Follow Me Mode</a>.</li>
</ul>

p><b>Note: </b></span></span></span>In addition, you can <a href="AddingPeopleIphone.html">add members from the Prysm iPhone app</a>, but you cannot add guests.</p>


<h2>Using the project lobby</h2>

<p>A project's lobby can include both guests and members.</p>
<ul>
<li>For guests in the lobby, any project member can click <b>Admit</b> or <b>Decline</b>, which allows or denies that guest temporary access to the project (see <a href="AddingAllPeople.html#AddingGuestsToProject">Guests</a>). </li>
<>For members in the lobby, the project owner can click <b>Add</b> or <b>Decline</b>, which allows or denies that user to be a member in the project (see <a href="AddingAllPeople.html#AddingMembersToProject">Members</a>).</li>
</ul>
